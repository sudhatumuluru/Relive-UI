                    Personal videos have become an essential part of life, especially if they are pictured by professionals on oneâ€™s special events and/or occasions. Most of the time, users intend to keep all such videos stored in physical devices and keep them safe. However, fact is that no physical device can last long enough. Some wear out while some may be lost when not in use.</p>
